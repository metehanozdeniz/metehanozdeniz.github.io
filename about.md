Hey there, I'm **Metehan**. I'm a computer engineer candidate, passionate about learning new skills and creating software to make the world a better place. I am a curious person and a fast learner, hard work doesn't scare me. My goal is to create things that make a difference. I love art and technology. My biggest motivation is Turkey’s founder.
